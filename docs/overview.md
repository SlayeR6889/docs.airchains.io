# Overview

<span style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>
We are at the forefront of blockchain innovation, providing a multi-chain zkFHE (Zero-Knowledge Fully Homomorphic Encryption) framework that ensures privacy, security, and interoperability.
</span>

<span style={{ fontSize: '17px' }}>
Our platform is designed to support various blockchain virtual machines, including EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), SVM (Solana Virtual Machine), and CosmWasm. This versatility allows seamless integration and interaction across different blockchain ecosystems. By combining the strengths of [Zero-Knowledge proofs](https://docs.airchains.io/concepts/intro-to-zkfhe/zk-proofs) and [Fully Homomorphic Encryption](https://docs.airchains.io/concepts/intro-to-zkfhe/fully-homomorphic-encryption), we enable secure computations on encrypted data, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected. Our multi-chain support enhances interoperability, facilitating smooth and secure data and asset transfers between different blockchain networks. Whether you are developing decentralized applications or looking to enhance the privacy and security of your blockchain operations, Airchains provides the tools and infrastructure needed to build a robust, interconnected ecosystem.
